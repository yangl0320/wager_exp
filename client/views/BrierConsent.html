                <p> We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online experiment. This experiment is part of a research project whose purpose is to study how people share their information and make predictions. In the experiment, you may be asked to answer questions related to a forecasting problem, to make a prediction, or to participate in decision making games. Further instructions will be provided once you decide to participate in the experiment. A single experimental session should take no more than 20 minutes.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Benefits and Risks:</span> You will be compensated with 20 cents as a base payment for participating in this experiment. Furthermore, you may be able to earn extra bonus depending on your decisions and choices and other participantsâ€™ decisions and choices in the experiment. We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this experiment. There is not direct benefit, except the payment, of participating in this experiment. Your participation will help with research on information elicitation and prediction.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Privacy:</span>Your decisions and choices will be kept confidential and stored in private. Identifiable information will never be used or shared.
