        <h2> Training Phrase </h2>
        <h4> <strong> Task description: </strong>
		<br> 
        This training phrase aims to give you an intuitive idea about what the forecast question looks like and how the forecast elicitation mechanism works. 
    	</h4>
        <h4> <strong> Forecast Task </strong> </h4>
        <h5> Our forecast task is a betting-like task, where you competes with other potential participants. The task consists of 10 questions. Each question will ask you to report a probability you think that a given event X will happen within one week. You are also asked to specify an amount of money, called bet, from the budget we assign to you, on each question to "support" the probability you forecast. Then, we will use the proxy pari-mutuel mechanism to compute your bouns, based on your proability forecast, your bet, the outcome of event X as well as the others' forecasts and bets. </h5>
